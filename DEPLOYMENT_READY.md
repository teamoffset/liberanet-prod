- `liberanet_carrier_bypass.js` - Comprehensive Android API hooks

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Files
- `carrier_bypass_config.json` - Advanced bypass settings
- `category_bypass.json` - Disabled carrier-specific categories

#### üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Scripts
- `deploy_to_device.sh` - Complete device deployment system
- `apply_carrier_fixes.sh` - Quick deployment alternative
- `patch_carrier_bypass.sh` - APK patching for permanent fixes
- `test_carrier_bypass.sh` - Testing and verification
- `check_device.sh` - Device readiness check

#### üìñ Documentation
- `COMPILATION_REPORT.md` - Detailed compilation report
- `CARRIER_BYPASS_GUIDE.md` - User guide
- `CARRIER_BYPASS_TECHNICAL_SUMMARY.md` - Technical documentation

## üéØ CARRIERS BYPASSED:
- ‚úÖ **Vivo** (vivo, telefonica patterns)
- ‚úÖ **TIM** (tim, tim.br patterns)
- ‚úÖ **Claro** (claro, america_movil patterns)  
- ‚úÖ **Oi** (oi, telemar patterns)

## üì± NEXT STEPS - DEPLOY TO YOUR PHYSICAL DEVICE:

### 1. Prepare Your Android Device:
```bash
# Enable Developer Options:
# Settings > About Phone > Tap "Build Number" 7 times

# Enable USB Debugging:
# Settings > Developer Options > USB Debugging = ON
```

### 2. Connect Device:
```bash
# Connect via USB cable and accept debugging authorization
adb devices  # Should show your device
```

### 3. Check Device Readiness:
```bash
./check_device.sh
```

### 4. Deploy Carrier Bypass:
```bash
./deploy_to_device.sh
```

## üîç WHAT THE BYPASS DOES:

1. **Runtime Hooks**: Intercepts carrier detection calls in real-time
2. **API Spoofing**: Makes mobile connections appear as WiFi
3. **Network Masking**: Hides cellular transport information
4. **Category Override**: Disables carrier-specific connection types
5. **Response Modification**: Returns WiFi identifiers instead of carrier names

## üéâ SUCCESS INDICATORS:

When working correctly, you'll see:
- `[BYPASS]` and `[FIX]` messages in terminal
- App shows WiFi connection options instead of carrier-specific ones
- No carrier-based restrictions or blocks
- Stable connection establishment
